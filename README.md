### An  Iot Based Biomedical Smart Wearable Device

There have been several instances in the past where the patient may have collapsed or is physically incapable at that moment to make the call for help. 

This device constantly monitors the health of the patient and sends an emergency notification to the caretakers wherein the necessary steps can be taken by them immediately potentially saving lives.

We aim to determine key body vitals of patients and user requirements for a wearable device so that it is used for long-term monitoring of heartbeat count, Spo2 level, body temperature, calories, step count, distance covered, and deep sleep.

Immensely helpful for those patients whose caretakers are out and have to monitor the patient’s health. 

Major parameters like (oxygen level in the blood, heart rate, body temperature, calories burnt, distance covered and the number of steps) can be kept track of remotely by their doctors, children, and parents, regardless of whether the patient is at home or elsewhere.

For any unpleasantness or complications experienced in the patient’s body, the caretakers immediately get a notification via WhatsApp and Android App.



### Components Used

- MAX 30102: It is an integrated heart-rate monitor and pulse oximetry module. This sensor is used to measure spO2 and heart rate.

- ADXL345: It is a small, thin, low-power, 3-axis accelerometer. This sensor is used to measure a patient’s steps.

- TFT ILI9341: This is a full-colour touch module of resolution 320 X 240. 

- ESP32: ESP32 is a series of low-cost, low-power systems on a chip microcontroller with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth.

- Google Firebase: Firebase is a cloud application which provides many services to develop an application. The services which we used here are real-time database and authentication

- Adobe XD: Adobe XD is a design tool which we used to create UI Interfaces.

- Android Studio: Android Studio is IDE which provides tools to develop android application.
